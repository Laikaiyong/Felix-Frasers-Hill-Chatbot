                    "This was my first time to Fraser Hill but after arriving at Fraser Hill, I knew that I had made the best choice. 1. LOCATION - strategically situated at Fraser Hill \"micro town\". Easy access to restaurants/cafe/mini markets/mosque/clock tower 2. ROOM - very spacious. I requested extra bed (with additional cost) as I stayed with my parents. Extra bed came together with complimentary breakfast. Besides, the room services didnt even forget to include extra towel, hand towel and even the drinking water for the extra bed requested. Water heater worked fine without any faulty. The water heater switch is located outside of the room (since they use keys to access to the rooms, I guess they want to be able to switch off the water heater when customers forgot to turn it off) Room is clean, though the shower looks a bit old I was scared of mosquitoes at first, but none of them showed at night. They do install mosquito netting. I WANT TO SHARE MORE BUT THIS LIMITATION DOESNT ALLOW ME"

I love that garden because of the various type of flowers and kids can play the playground. The hotel is not at the main centre of the hill so, very preferable for those who wanna stay in a very calm place. The only con is the carpet in the room felt like \"kesat\" or didn't wash for months and the balcony is not really clean. If you wanna have a great view of the golf course, if possible please request for 2nd or 3rd floor."

A great scenic, adventurous ride up in the evening along with that mystic feeling. We came from Singapore but our bike ride from Hatyai to Fraser's Hill was one of most adventurous ones besides Genting & Cameron. We checked in late evening on 11 Feb 2019 and out tireness from long journey gone after we reached our destination at Puncak Inn. The services and great hospitality from the staffs was heartwarming. The surroundings definitely captured our heart. Dinner and buffet breakfast were delicious at Puncak Inn. There is a nearby mamak shop that closes at 11pm to buy some snacks and drinks. Perfect weekend gateway from the searing heat of the city. Great morning walk with the crispiness of the air from the mountains. Last but not least , the staffs did a great job in managing the resorts and are very helpful and accommodative. Gonna bring my children next time, this time driving up to Fraser's Hill."

Unit is very spacious, however floor is a bit dusty as when we came in and one of the shower have pretty low water pressure. The furniture in the unit look quite outdated but functional still. However, this place has great view and you are able to rent a bicycle to cycle around the place. Only thing is the receptionist area is very quite and dark it's almost scary even if its during the day. The unit here looks rundown because of the paint and mold. But, i enjoyed my stay regardless."
